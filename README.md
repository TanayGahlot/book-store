## Installing Node
To install Node on your machine, go to https://nodejs.org and click on the Download button. Depending on your computer's platform (Windows, MacOS or Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded.
Follow along the instructions to install Node on your machine. 
Note: On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH during the installation steps.

## Verifying the Node Installation
Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with admin privileges.
To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the following at the command prompt to check for the version of Node and NPM
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install
Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

With the --production flag (or when the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production), npm will not install modules listed in devDependencies.

NOTE: The --production flag has no particular meaning when adding a dependency to a project.

### `npm start`
